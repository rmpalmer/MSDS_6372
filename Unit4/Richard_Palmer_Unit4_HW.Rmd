## Conceptual Questions

### For a time series to be stationary

- Constant Mean
- Constant Variance
- Constant Autocorrelations

### if a timee series model ..
includes and explantory variable such as time itself, or some other predictor,
then the original time series of the response is not stationary.
(FALSE) - this could *hide* nonstationarity, but would not mean it is necessarily present.

### The main drawback of serially correlated observations is..

That there is less information from which to create a model.

### The main advantage of serrially correlated observations is..

that it is possible to make predictions about the future values of the time series.
